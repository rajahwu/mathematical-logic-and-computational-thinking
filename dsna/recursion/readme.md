# Recursion and Backtracking

## Examples Algorithms of Recursion

* Fibonacci Series, Factorial Finding
* Merge Sort, Quick Sort
* Binary Search
* Tree Traversals and many Tree Problem:
    InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder
* Graph Traversals: DFS [Depth First Search]
    and BFS [Breadth First Search]
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Towers of Hanoi
* Backtracking ALgorithms
